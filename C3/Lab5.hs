--Create a function that count the number of occurrences of all characters from a given string
--countThem :: String -> [(Char, Int)]



--Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. 
--Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case yet. 
--Create a function, that computes for a given even integer number the list of pairs of primes, that satisfies the rule of Goldbach's conjecture
--goldbach :: Int-> [(Int, Int)]



--In most cases, if an even number is written as the sum of two prime numbers, one of them is very small. 
--We will be searching for cases that violates this rule. Create a function, that has three parameters. 
--First two defines an interval, where we will be searching for Goldbach numbers. The last parameter is the limit. 
--For each number in this interval, find Goldbach's pair with smallest prime number. 
--If this smallest number is bigger than given limit, the corresponding pair will be in the result

--Create a function that generates all combinations of given length from the characters from given string
